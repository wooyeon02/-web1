   The company's origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and
   Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as
   the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile.
   The fuel was not gasoline, it was a much more volatile petroleum spirit
   with several names including ligrane/ligrain/ligroin.
   This was used as a degreaser, spot remover, paint thinner, etc.
   and was so quick to burn or explode, it was not stored inside.
   The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".
