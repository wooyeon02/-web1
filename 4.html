      Founded in July 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors,
      the companyâ€™s name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla.
      The next three employees were Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and J. B. Straubel,
      all of whom are named as co-founders of the company.
      Musk, who formerly served as chairman and is the current CEO,
      said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a technology company and independent automaker,
      aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the average consumer.
      In February 2017, Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla, Inc.

      To produce these, Tesla operates multiple production and assembly plants.
